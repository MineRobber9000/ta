# Versioning
Versions are labeled like so:
 - "r": stands for release, begins every version number.
 - number (i.e; 1): the number release it is.
 - "b": stands for beta, ends every beta version number.
 
 For example, "r1b" is the first beta release, and "r2" is the second main release.
 
 After the first release, decimals will be used. (i.e; "r2.3b" is the third beta release for version 2)
